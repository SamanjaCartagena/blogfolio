      <strong>
      My coding career began in college. I was majoring in Computer Science. 
      I built a custom website for a neighborhood beauty salon using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
       It was a static website that only focused on aesthetics and photos but I was happy.
       I have finally managed to make sense of what all the learning was about and earn $600 from the experience.
        For the first time in my life, I felt like a creator, a designer, a marketer and an entrepreneur at the same.
         My little project opened my mind. I was over the moon with euphoric feelings of doing something valuable with the skills that I acquired in college. 
         I also self taught myself a lot of coding from You tube. 
         After my project was over, I became even more determined to take my coding career very seriously. 
         I started learning from You tube. My entire days would revolve around coding along with Youtubers. 
         But then, I started feeling very empty. </strong></p>

          <strong>
          My career satisfaction was dissolving.
          I was not doing well in school projects. Learning from you tube was backfiring an
          d I was becoming a bad coder. Now, donâ€™t get me wrong, I think Youtube is a great
           platform for programmers to learn how to code. I think it has transformed the world
            of learning. But there is a darker side to this kind of learning, especially coding.
             You can pause, play, rewind, and fast forward a video. You can make great projects with
              great Youtube coding videos but not actually learn anything. I got into something called
               a tutorial nightmare. I kept watching Youtube videos and creating programs and projects.
                One tutorial after another, without actually absorbing or learning much. It was like 
                cheating from a friend during a hard test. Mindless copying of codes that I was not creating. 
                I was coding for many many hours a day. But yet, something did not feel right. 
                I had projects to showcase in my portfolio but I only have a vague memory of
                 how I have created it. Then this idea came to me. I started taking notes
                  and screen shots while programming. I decided to take notes on JavaScript 
                  because to me that was the hardest and I wrote down all the codes in a notebook. 
                  Before going to bed every night I would open my notebook and review those codes. 
                  After a few days JavaScript became my favorite, it never appeared like homework,
                   or work or an assignment. It always seemed like a fun game I enjoyed playing
                    around with. Regularly reviewing these notes transformed my life and my 
                    understanding of JavaScript.
       I am hoping to bring out the same from my readers with my book Playing Around with JavaScript.
